# Standard Image Quality

## Description

By default, WordPress automatically compresses / reduces the quality of JPG images to 90% in order for them to load faster with slight or negligible quality difference to the untrained eye. While this matters very little to a majority of the bloggers out there, this can matter greatly to professional photographers and artists who want their images to be shown in their full beauty.

This plugin will, instead, tell WordPress to use 100% quality on JPG images.

## Installation
